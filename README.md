# Juspay-Assignment
Objective: To implement functionality similar to React useState hook without using React and only Vanilla Javascript.

Note: there are two branches in this repo --> main branch and "subscriber-and-listener" branch

_main branch_ --> implements the useState hook using the concept of closures and similar to how react implements it.
_subscriber-and-listener branch_ --> implements the useState hook using the concept of subscriber and listener.

__Limitations of this project__:
- Basic Scope: The project focuses on implementing a simplified version of the useState hook on a small scale. It doesn't cover more advanced features offered by state management libraries like React, such as context, reducers, or effects.

- Performance: The project doesn't focus on performance optimizations. It doesn't use memoization or other techniques to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

- Limited Functionality: While the project demonstrates the core concept of state management using custom functions , its important to note that the implemented system lacks features like asynchronous updates, derived state, and complex state transformations.

- No webpack or bundlers are used here.
